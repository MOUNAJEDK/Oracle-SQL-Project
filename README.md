# Oracle-SQL-Project
This project was an assignment for one of my university courses.

The aim of the project is to register a video game development publishing company. The database will contain and manage the information of the companies, these being: the studios owned by them, details about the employees who work for these studios and their roles in these studios, the games on which the studios contributed in their development, the series and the genres that they belong to, as well as on which platforms they are available.
